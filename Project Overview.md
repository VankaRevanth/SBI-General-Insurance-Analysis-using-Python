# SBI General Insurance using Python

## How SBI General Insurance Uses Data to Improve Car Insurance

**About**

Let's start with a bit of background on SBI General Insurance. It's part of the State Bank of India family, one of the biggest and most trusted names in banking. Since starting in 2009, SBI General has grown really 
fast. They've gone from just 17 branches to over 141 across India and have helped more than 55.55 crore customers!

That's huge, right? And there's more – they've won awards like ‘Insurer of the Year’ in 2020 and 2021, and in 2022, they were named the 'Best General Insurance Company of the Year'.

So, how did they get here? A big part of their success story is data – collecting it, analyzing it, and then using it to make better insurance products for people like you and me.

**Objective**

- The Insurance Manager aims to improve how well the insurance portfolio does by focusing on the areas that make the most money and making better models for figuring out risks. They plan to use what customers say to 
  make their insurance products and customer service better, hoping to make customers happier.

- The Insurance Manager also wants to make their team leaders stronger by giving them more training and encouraging them to work together and come up with new ideas.

Let's inspect our dataset. The dataset offers a comprehensive overview of the vehicle insurance landscape, providing insights into customer preferences, dealership networks, financing options, and insurance policy 
choices. This dataset can be valuable for analysing trends in vehicle insurance, assessing regional variations in vehicle sales and insurance coverages, and understanding consumer behavior in the vehicle insurance 
market.
